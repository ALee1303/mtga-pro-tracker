## INSTALLATION STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
IMPORTANT! Program needs .NET 4.6.2 or higher to work. If app doesn't start on your PC (no interface shows up after you launch EXE) you should install .NET from here!

* Download MTGA Pro Tracker (currect version is v.1.3.1) from our github here: https://github.com/Razviar/mtga-pro-tracker/raw/master/MTGApro.zip Antivirus software (including Windows Defender) could be alarmed because of the app's ability to upload data to remote server and automatic update feature. So if Antivirus is alarmed, you should add this App to exceptions.
* Unpack it and launch MSI Installer.
* Get your token from widget on this page: https://mtgarena.pro/mtga-pro-tracker/ You must be registered user to get token!
* Copy this digit-letter code and paste it to input field of Tracker app.
* Right after you paste the code, your username (from MTGArena.pro website) will be displayed in the app window. Tokens are being stored, token authorization happens just once. Next time you launch the app, it will remember youyr token and username.
That's it! If  you've launched MTGA on his PC before, upload will start instantly. And when new cards will be added, those will be updated as well.

## Windows protected your PC?
